# CNN based early detection tools
one small project for image classification using tensorflow. pictures are from ASD children (but won't be shared)

## why do you share this code in github
well, my disk crushed unfortunately a few weeks ago. this pushes me to store my toys on github. so welcome any doubts and questions! do not wait, just attack me if found silly codes! 

## data source
sorry, this can not be shared. pictures are collected from ASD children who praticipated in House-Tree-People test. So the pictures are black and white, and captured by ipads to be stored in the same size (1024, 512). In fact I am also hunts for HTP based data.

## network structure
I modeled after resnet.

## future updates
yes. I will add some new visualizing tools including CAM. I am attracted by thesis "A Stochastic Grammar of Images" (url:http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/papers/Reprint_Grammar.pdf) but I am a pure layman. 

## what about performance
it varies with different datasets since I collect pictures from several hospitals in 10 months ... will the record auc = 0.82 work?
